# Uninformed Search

Required libraries.
===================
The user must have the libraries installed below to run the program:

* util
* time
* pygame
* search
* numpy as np
* matplotlib
* graphviz
* IPython
* os
* sys
* numpy 
* pyautogui

Run.
===================
You need to open the terminal in the same place where you have the file
```bash
python Pacman4x4.py -your option-
```
"your option" represents:

 1 for Depth-first search (FDS).
 
 2 for Breath-first Search (BFS).
 
 3 for Uniform cost search (UCS) .  
 
Results.
===================
You can see the time it takes the algorithm to reach the target in the terminal, in the third option you can see the cost

the path traveled is the blue and the path found is lila, this images are automatically saved under the name screenshot.
In our opinion the best algorithm for solving the maze was the BFS, because it shows the shortest path and the time isnt too different between the others.
